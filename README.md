# Project 1: Population Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Introduction
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing population data for various states to make it suitable for analysis and visualization. The goal is to transform raw data into a format that is easy to analyze and derive insights from.

## Rationale
1. **Renaming Unnamed Column:** The first column lacked a clear name, making it difficult to reference. Naming it 'Category' clarifies its role as a descriptor for each row.
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Missing data can distort analyses. Removing rows where all state columns are null helps maintain data integrity without losing too much information.
3. **Data Types Conversion:** The dataset contained numeric values in string format. Converting them to numeric types is essential for any mathematical or statistical analysis.
4. **Reshaping Data:** The dataset was in a wide format, which can be unwieldy for analysis. Reshaping it into a long format makes it easier to manipulate and analyze, especially for state-wise comparisons.

## Methods and Tools
### Libraries and Functions
- **Pandas Library:** Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `.rename()` to rename columns.
  - `.dropna()` to handle missing values.
  - `.melt()` to reshape the data.
- **Custom Function:** A custom function was created to convert percentage strings to float values.

### Process
1. **Loading Data:** The dataset was loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Renaming Columns:** The unnamed first column was renamed to 'Category'.
3. **Converting Data Types:** Numeric values were converted from string format to appropriate numeric types.
4. **Handling Missing Values:** Rows with all state columns null were removed.
5. **Reshaping Data:** The data was reshaped from a wide format to a long format for easier analysis.

## Results and Output
- **Cleaned Data:** The dataset is now free of formatting issues and in a suitable shape for analysis. Each row represents a unique data point with a clear category, state, and numerical value.
- **Reshaped Data:** The dataset has been transformed from wide to long format, making it easier to manipulate and analyze. This format facilitates state-wise comparisons and other analyses.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes various demographic metrics for different states, such as:
- **Total Population**
- **Gender Distribution (Male, Female)**
- **Median Age**
- **Race Distribution (e.g., White, Black or African American, Asian)**
- **Economic Indicators (e.g., Employed, Unemployed, Below Poverty Level)**

### Key Findings
1. **Total Population:** Distribution analysis showed a right-skewed distribution, indicating that most states have smaller populations, while a few have significantly larger populations.
2. **Gender Distribution:** Both male and female population percentages showed normal distributions centered around 50%, suggesting a roughly equal gender distribution across states.
3. **Median Age:** The histogram for median age indicated a relatively normal distribution, with most states having a median age clustered around the central value.
4. **Economic Indicators:** Histograms for employment and poverty levels showed variations in employment rates and economic disparities across states.

## Conclusion
This project successfully cleaned and reshaped the population data, making it ready for further analysis and visualization. The cleaned dataset now allows for accurate and insightful analysis of various demographic metrics across states, facilitating better understanding and decision-making.
